  <p><strong>Type:</strong> Personal project (interview design problem)</p>
  <p><strong>Role:</strong> Mechanism concept, iteration, and CAD</p>
  <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Hand sketches, mechanism kinematics, off-the-shelf component selection, CAD layout</p>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    The task was to design a purely mechanical system mounted to a cart that rides on linear guides.
    The only power source is a timing belt running underneath the cart that can rotate in
    <strong>one direction only</strong>. The mechanism must:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Drive the cart forward.</li>
    <li>Drive the cart backward.</li>
    <li>Allow the cart to float freely (neutral).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I approached this as a state-based mechanism design problem, iterated through several
    prototype concepts on paper, and converged on a compact mechanism that uses a pair of
    belt-engaging gears, idler wheels, and a spring-loaded selector to switch between
    forward, reverse, and neutral.

  <h3>Problem & Assumptions</h3>
  <p>
    The given setup was a carriage on linear guides, with a timing belt looped underneath.
    The belt motion and tension are fixed; all control must come from the mechanism that
    attaches to the cart. To make the problem concrete, I adopted the following assumptions: 
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Timing belt tension ~<strong>250 lbf</strong>, 2&quot; belt spacing, 1&quot; belt width, trapezoidal profile, ~3&quot; engagement length.</li>
    <li>Off-the-shelf components are preferred (gears, rollers, bearings, springs), with some machined parts as needed.</li>
    <li>Mechanism must support three modes: left, right, and neutral (free movement).</li>
    <li>Mechanism can be fastened to the cart via hardware; no modification to the belt drive itself.</li>
    <li>Initial prototype focus; future iterations can refine packaging and ergonomics.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Concept Exploration & Prototypes</h3>
  <p>
    I explored several concepts using hand sketches, focusing on how to engage and disengage
    teeth or rollers with the belt while controlling the contact force. Early concepts used
    linkages to press linear “tooth bars” into the belt; later concepts transitioned to
    rotational engagement with gears.

      <figcaption>Later sketches converging toward rotational gear engagement rather than linear teeth.</figcaption>
    </figure>
  </div>

  <h3>Prototype Tradeoffs</h3>
  <p>
    I evaluated the concepts based on force path, manufacturability, and ease of engagement:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Concepts A–D used hinged arms and linear teeth pushed into the belt. These required
      multiple hinges and springs to generate compression, leading to uneven contact and
      potential disturbance of belt tension.
    </li>
    <li>
      Prototype E switched to <strong>rotational gear engagement</strong> with idler wheels to maintain belt
      tension. Rotational engagement required less compression force and gave more controlled,
      repeatable contact with the belt.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Selected Design – Prototype E</h3>
  <p>
    Prototype E was selected as the final concept. It uses a central drive gear to engage
    the timing belt and a set of idler wheels to press the belt into the gear while maintaining
    tension. A manual selector mechanism switches which side of the belt is engaged or lifts
    the mechanism into neutral.

  <h3>Mechanism Details</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Belt-engaging gear:</strong>
      A toothed gear interfaces with the timing belt profile. The belt’s one-direction motion
      drives this gear, which in turn pulls the cart.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Idler wheels and slots:</strong>
      Idler wheels above the belt push it into the drive gear. Slotted mounting holes on the
      idler bolts allow fine adjustment of belt engagement and tension at the mechanism.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Selector and locking:</strong>
      A spring-loaded shaft and detent lock the mechanism into forward, reverse, or neutral
      positions, preventing accidental switching under vibration.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Off-the-shelf components:</strong>
      Rollers, bearings, fasteners, and springs are selected from standard catalogs
      (e.g., McMaster-Carr), while only the bracketry and selector geometry require machining.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Open architecture:</strong>
      The mechanism is intentionally open so operators can clearly see belt engagement, spring
      position, and wheel contact, simplifying inspection and adjustment. 
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Results</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Defined a clear, three-state mechanism (forward, reverse, neutral) using a one-direction
      belt as the only power source.
    </li>
    <li>
      Reduced complexity compared to linkage-heavy concepts by using rotational gear engagement
      and idler wheels instead of large compression linkages.
    </li>
    <li>
      Demonstrated a practical balance between off-the-shelf hardware and targeted machined parts.
    </li>
    <li>
      Produced a CAD layout that could be taken into prototyping with a relatively small
      amount of additional detailing and hardware specification.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Notes & Future Improvements</h3>
  <p>
    Future improvements could include building a physical prototype to validate engagement
    forces and ergonomics, optimizing packaging to reduce weight and envelope, and adding
    safety interlocks or covers if used in a production environment. A simple kinematic
    animation would also help communicate the forward/reverse/neutral transitions to
    stakeholders.
