  <p><strong>Type:</strong> Personal project (based on interview problem)</p>
  <p><strong>Role:</strong> Mechanism and concept designer</p>
  <p><strong>Tools:</strong> Hand sketches, mechanism kinematics, McMaster-Carr component selection, basic CAD for layout</p>

  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    This project started as an interview design problem: 
    a cart sits on top of a continuously rotating belt that can only move in one direction. 
    The task was to design a manual mechanism that can:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Drive the cart forward.</li>
    <li>Drive the cart backward.</li>
    <li>Allow the cart to free-float (neutral).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    My final concept uses two belt-engaging rollers on a selector shaft and a simple 
    detent mechanism. A handle moves the selector between forward, reverse, and neutral, 
    engaging one of two driven rollers against the belt while a spring-and-shaft detent 
    prevents accidental switching.
  </p>

  <h3>Problem</h3>
  <p>
    The belt under the cart is driven continuously in a single direction. There is no 
    control over the belt itself; all control has to come from a mechanism attached 
    to the cart. The mechanism must:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Use the one-direction belt as the power source.</li>
    <li>Move the cart in either direction on command.</li>
    <li>Provide a neutral mode where the cart can be moved freely.</li>
    <li>Be manually actuated, robust, and resistant to accidental mode changes.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Constraints & Requirements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Mechanism must fit within a limited envelope under or integrated into the cart.</li>
    <li>Only the belt direction is fixed; reversing motion must come from the mechanism.</li>
    <li>Use standard purchased components where practical (bearings, shafts, springs, hardware).</li>
    <li>Have clearly defined, repeatable positions for forward, reverse, and neutral.</li>
    <li>Include a way to lock each position so vibration cannot cause an unintended change.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Approach</h3>
  <p>
    I began by breaking the problem into discrete states and power flow:
    the belt delivers motion in one direction; the mechanism must either couple that
    motion directly, invert it, or decouple it.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Explored concepts using clutches, friction rollers, and pawl/ratchet arrangements
      to switch between forward, reverse, and neutral.
    </li>
    <li>
      Evaluated manufacturability and complexity, aiming to minimize custom machined parts
      and maximize use of McMaster-Carr hardware (shafts, bearings, springs, gears/rollers).
    </li>
    <li>
      Converged on a layout with two belt-engaging rollers, spaced apart, each associated 
      with one direction of cart travel.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Final Mechanism Concept</h3>
  <p>
    The final design uses a selector shaft with two driven rollers (or toothed gears / pulleys) 
    that can be pressed into the belt from above. The belt always moves in one direction, 
    but depending on which roller is engaged, the cart sees motion in forward or reverse.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Two drive rollers:</strong>
      Two rollers are mounted on a common housing under the cart, spaced along the belt. 
      The geometry is arranged so that when the belt is driving one roller, the reaction 
      force translates into forward motion; when the other roller is engaged, the belt’s 
      one-direction motion is converted into cart motion in the opposite direction 
      (for example via the orientation of the roller axes or an internal gear/train flip).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Selector shaft and handle:</strong>
      One of the rollers is mounted on a pivoting selector shaft. A manual handle at the top
      of the cart rotates this shaft between three detented positions:
      forward, neutral, and reverse. In each position, the selector shaft cams or pushes
      the appropriate roller into contact with the belt.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Neutral position:</strong>
      In neutral, the selector shaft retracts both rollers so they float clear of the belt.
      The cart is then free-floating and can be moved without belt influence.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Detent and spring lock:</strong>
      A spring-loaded detent pin and a small groove pattern on the selector shaft provide
      positive stops for the three positions. The operator feels a solid “click” into each
      state, and vibration will not cause the mechanism to drift between modes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Use of standard components:</strong>
      Bearings, shafts, springs, fasteners, and many of the rollers were chosen from
      McMaster-Carr. Custom machined parts were limited to the selector shaft geometry,
      housing, and any brackets that required specific dimensions or interfaces to the cart.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Results</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Defined a complete mechanism concept that satisfies the core requirement:
      using a one-direction belt to provide forward, reverse, and neutral motion for a cart.
    </li>
    <li>
      Demonstrated a clear state-based design (three positions) with a robust detent 
      and locking strategy to avoid accidental mode changes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Showed how to decompose an interview-level problem into physical states, power flow, 
      kinematic layout, and then down to a concrete bill of materials using off-the-shelf parts.
    </li>
    <li>
      Identified which elements must be custom machined (selector shaft, housing interfaces)
      versus which can be purchased (bearings, springs, handles, hardware).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Notes & Future Improvements</h3>
  <p>
    As future work, I would build a simple CAD model and kinematic animation to validate
    clearances and check belt contact forces, then prototype the mechanism to confirm
    engagement forces and ergonomics of the handle. Additional improvements could include
    adding simple position labels and a secondary safety interlock if used in a 
    production environment.
