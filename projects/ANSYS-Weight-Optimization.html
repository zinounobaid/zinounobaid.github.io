  <h2>Project Title Placeholder</h2>
  <p><strong>Role:</strong> Mechanical Engineer (personal project)</p>
  <p><strong>Tools:</strong> SolidWorks, basic FEA, hand calculations</p>

  <h3>Problem</h3>
  <p>
    Describe the engineering problem in 2–4 sentences. 
    Mention the context (manufacturing / personal), and any key numbers (loads, tolerances, etc.) if you can.
  </p>

  <h3>Constraints & Requirements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Material and thickness constraints.</li>
    <li>Manufacturing process (e.g., laser cutting + press brake).</li>
    <li>Target safety factor, deflection limits, or failure criteria.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Approach</h3>
  <p>
    Walk through your steps: initial concept, modeling, analysis, prototypes or iterations,
    and how you made design tradeoffs.
  </p>

  <h3>Results</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Quantitative improvements (e.g., failure rate, weight, cost, assembly time).</li>
    <li>Qualitative outcomes (e.g., easier to assemble, more robust to variation).</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Notes & Future Improvements</h3>
  <p>
    Briefly mention what you would improve next if this went into production 
    (e.g., additional testing, alternative materials, more detailed FEA).
