  <h3>Problem</h3>
  <p>
    Aircraft structural components need to maintain required strength and stiffness while minimizing weight
    to improve fuel efficiency. The goal of this project was to reduce the mass of a bracket-like component
    while keeping stresses within allowable limits and preserving overall stiffness.
  </p>

  <h3>Constraints & Requirements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain stresses below the material yield strength with a target safety factor.</li>
    <li>Preserve the original mounting interface and overall envelope of the part.</li>
    <li>Keep deflection under a specified limit at critical load cases.</li>
    <li>Use a manufacturable geometry suitable for machining or standard fabrication.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>
  I began with the baseline CAD geometry and imported it into ANSYS to understand the stress 
  distribution under three critical load cases (horizontal, 45° angled, and vertical loading at 
  the eye of the lever). To realistically represent the boundary conditions, I fixed the contact 
  areas at the bolt holes rather than the entire bottom surface, since that region was a candidate 
  for future material removal.
</p>
<p>
  For the initial runs I used a normal mesh to quickly identify low-stress regions across all 
  three load cases. Based on those results, I iteratively removed material from consistently 
  under-utilized areas in SolidWorks, exported the updated geometry as a STEP file, and 
  re-imported it into ANSYS for re-analysis. To maintain accuracy as the geometry evolved, 
  I applied a refined global body sizing (0.1 in element size) with fine mesh settings and 
  then checked mesh quality plots to confirm that most elements were high quality, with only 
  a small number of lower-quality elements near the load application region.
</p>
<p>
  Each design iteration followed a repeatable loop: update CAD → regenerate mesh with the 
  refined settings → apply boundary conditions and loads → solve for Von Mises stress and 
  deflection → verify that maximum stress remained below the allowable limit with an 
  acceptable factor of safety. If an iteration exceeded allowable stress, I reverted the last 
  material cut and explored alternative regions for weight reduction.
</p>


<h3>Results</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Reduced the part mass from <strong>110.86 g</strong> to <strong>48.51 g</strong>, 
    a net weight reduction of approximately <strong>56%</strong>, while maintaining 
    structural performance under all specified load cases.
  </li>
  <li>
    Verified that the maximum Von Mises stress in each load case remained below the 
    material yield strength, with an overall factor of safety of approximately 
    <strong>1.03</strong> based on the ratio of yield stress (145 ksi) to peak 
    simulated stress (140 ksi).
  </li>
  <li>
    Confirmed good mesh quality on the final design, with the vast majority of elements 
    in the highest quality range and only a small cluster of lower-quality elements 
    localized near the load application region.
  </li>
  <li>
    Demonstrated a systematic workflow for simulation-driven weight optimization 
    (boundary condition definition, mesh refinement, stress interpretation, and 
    iterative geometry updates) that can be applied to other components.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes & Future Improvements</h3>
<p>
  Future work could include running a formal topology optimization study to generate a 
  more organic optimal material layout, validating the design under additional load cases 
  (e.g., off-axis loads or dynamic conditions), and comparing manufacturability and cost 
  for different fabrication approaches. Extending the workflow to include thermal and 
  fatigue analyses would also make the part more robust for real-world aerospace 
  applications.
