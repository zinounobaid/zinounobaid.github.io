  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    The goal of this project was to reduce the mass of a lever-like aircraft component
    while maintaining structural integrity under three critical load cases. Using 
    CAD and FEA in ANSYS, I iteratively removed material from low-stress regions, 
    validating each design against stress and deflection limits.

  <h3>Problem</h3>
  <p>
    Aircraft components must stay within allowable stress and deflection limits while 
    being as light as possible to improve fuel efficiency. The starting design met 
    the structural requirements but was heavier than necessary. The task was to 
    reduce weight without exceeding allowable stress or deflection under:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>1,250 lb horizontal load at the eye of the lever</li>
    <li>1,875 lb load at 45° (combined horizontal + vertical)</li>
    <li>2,500 lb vertical load at the eye</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Approach</h3>
  <p>
    I imported the baseline CAD into ANSYS and defined realistic boundary conditions 
    by fixing only the bolt-hole contact regions instead of the entire bottom face, 
    since that area was a candidate for future material removal.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ran initial analyses with a normal mesh to identify low-stress regions that were
      good candidates for material removal.
    </li>
    <li>
      Iteratively removed material in SolidWorks from consistently low-stress regions,
      exported the updated geometry, and re-ran FEA for all three load cases.
    </li>
    <li>
      Refined the mesh using a global body sizing of 0.1 in and checked mesh quality
      plots to ensure the optimized design was still well-resolved.
    </li>
    <li>
      After each iteration, compared maximum Von Mises stress and deflection against
      allowable limits and reverted or adjusted cuts if stresses increased too much.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Results</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Reduced part mass from <strong>110.86 g</strong> to <strong>48.51 g</strong>, 
      a weight reduction of approximately <strong>56%</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Maintained a maximum Von Mises stress below material yield, with an overall 
      factor of safety of about <strong>1.03</strong> (145 ksi allowable vs. ~140 ksi max).
    </li>
    <li>
      Kept deflection within the original allowable limits for all three load cases.
    </li>
    <li>
      Achieved high mesh quality in the final design, with only a small region of 
      lower-quality elements localized near the applied load.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Notes & Future Improvements</h3>
  <p>
    Future work could include applying topology optimization to generate an even more 
    efficient material layout, running fatigue and thermal analyses for additional 
    load cases, and comparing manufacturability and cost across different design 
    variants and processes.
