  <h3>Problem</h3>
  <p>
    Aircraft structural components need to maintain required strength and stiffness while minimizing weight
    to improve fuel efficiency. The goal of this project was to reduce the mass of a bracket-like component
    while keeping stresses within allowable limits and preserving overall stiffness.
  </p>

  <h3>Constraints & Requirements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Maintain stresses below the material yield strength with a target safety factor.</li>
    <li>Preserve the original mounting interface and overall envelope of the part.</li>
    <li>Keep deflection under a specified limit at critical load cases.</li>
    <li>Use a manufacturable geometry suitable for machining or standard fabrication.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Approach</h3>
  <p>
    I started from the baseline CAD geometry, applied the given boundary conditions and loads in ANSYS,
    and identified regions with low utilization (low stress relative to allowable). I iteratively removed
    material from low-stress zones and refined fillets and cutouts, re-running the FEA after each change to
    track the impact on peak stress and deflection. This process continued until I reached a balance between
    weight reduction and structural performance.
  </p>

  <h3>Results</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduced component mass by approximately XX% compared to the baseline design.</li>
    <li>Maintained a safety factor of at least YY under the worst-case load.</li>
    <li>Kept maximum deflection within the original allowable limit.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Notes & Future Improvements</h3>
  <p>
    With more time, I would explore topology optimization to automatically identify optimal material
    distribution, validate the design under additional load cases (fatigue, off-axis loads), and compare
    manufacturability and cost between different design variants.
