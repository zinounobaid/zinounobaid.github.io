  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    The customer provided a 3D model of a complex sheet metal part that mates to the
    aircraft skin. My responsibility was not to design the part itself, but to create
    the tooling and flat pattern needed so the part could be manufactured accurately and
    repeatedly. I designed a custom forming mold and adjusted the flat pattern strategy
    to ensure the final doubly-curved part matched the 3D model and that the rivet holes
    aligned correctly with the aircraft structure.

  <h3>Problem</h3>
  <p>
    The customer’s 3D model defined a sheet metal part that sits on the aircraft skin and
    is bent in two axes (saucer-like curvature). The geometry included:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A large, non-symmetric central cutout.</li>
    <li>Two symmetric rivet holes at each end that reference existing aircraft structure.</li>
    <li>Curvature driven entirely by the supplied 3D model, not a simple single-axis bend.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When we evaluated forming options, it became clear that bending directly to the final
    shape with full-size holes would cause warping and small shifts in hole location.
    Because the end holes have to match existing structure on the aircraft, even small
    misalignment would create installation issues and rework.
  </p>

  <h3>Constraints & Requirements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Final part must closely match the customer’s 3D model and sit flush on the aircraft skin.</li>
    <li>End rivet holes must align with existing structure after forming.</li>
    <li>Central cutout shape and position must remain within tolerance.</li>
    <li>Process must be repeatable for production, not a one-off hand-formed part.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Approach</h3>
  <p>
    Starting from the customer’s 3D model, I generated a flat pattern and drawing for the
    part and then focused on how to form it without losing control of the geometry. We tried
    straightforward bending approaches and confirmed that warping around the bends caused the
    holes to move enough to matter.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Flat pattern with pilot holes:</strong>
      Instead of cutting the end rivet holes to final size in the flat state, I used smaller
      pilot holes in the flat pattern. These pilots were used for location and fixturing rather
      than as the final rivet-size holes. This reduced the risk of distortion “locking in” the
      final hole pattern during forming.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Custom forming mold design:</strong>
      I designed a forming mold that followed the doubly-curved surface dictated by the
      customer 3D model. The mold controlled the overall shape and curvature of the part so
      the operator could form the blank to the correct profile instead of free-forming it.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Collaboration with the machine shop:</strong>
      Our machine shop manufactured the mold from the drawing and 3D data I provided. Once the
      mold was complete, I checked key dimensions and surface features against the drawing and
      the original 3D model to confirm it matched the intended profile.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Final drilling after forming:</strong>
      After forming, the part was located using the pilot holes and the final rivet hole size
      and position were brought in by drilling / match drilling to the aircraft structure.
      This separated control of the part shape from the final hole tolerances.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Results</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Established a repeatable forming process that produces parts matching the doubly-curved
      customer 3D model within tolerance.
    </li>
    <li>
      Improved rivet hole alignment after forming by using pilot holes and final drilling,
      reducing the need for hand-fit and rework.
    </li>
    <li>
      Delivered a forming mold that the machine shop could manufacture and use effectively,
      with geometry verified against the drawing and original 3D model.
    </li>
    <li>
      Created a tooling and flat pattern strategy that can be reused for similar doubly-curved
      sheet metal parts from other customer 3D models.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Notes & Future Improvements</h3>
  <p>
    Future improvements could include adding dedicated datums or hard stops on the mold for
    even tighter location control, refining the flat pattern to further minimize springback,
    and documenting a standard work procedure so operators can consistently set up and form
    similar parts with minimal trial and error.
