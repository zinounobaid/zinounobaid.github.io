  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    This project involved designing a forming mold and flat pattern strategy for a complex
    sheet metal part that mates to the aircraft skin. The part had curvature in two axes
    and a non-symmetric central cutout, plus two rivet holes at each end that had to line
    up precisely after forming. Conventional bending approaches caused warping and
    misalignment, so I designed a custom mold and modified the flat pattern to control
    the final geometry and hole locations.

  <h3>Problem</h3>
  <p>
    The part had to sit flush on the aircraft skin and follow a saucer-like curvature
    (bent in two axes). The geometry included:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A large, non-symmetric central hole.</li>
    <li>Two symmetric rivet holes at each end that reference existing structure.</li>
    <li>Curvature driven by the aircraft skin, not a simple single-axis bend.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    When we attempted to form the part using standard brake operations, the material
    warped during bending and the final hole locations shifted. Even small shifts were
    enough to cause misalignment with the mating structure, which is unacceptable for
    install and rework cost.
  </p>

  <h3>Constraints & Requirements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Part must conform closely to the doubly-curved aircraft skin without gaps.</li>
    <li>End rivet holes must align with existing structure after forming.</li>
    <li>Central cutout shape must remain within tolerance for clearance and access.</li>
    <li>Process must be repeatable on the shop floor with minimal hand rework.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Approach</h3>
  <p>
    We experimented with different forming methods and quickly confirmed that
    bending to final shape with full-size holes was causing unacceptable distortion.
    To control the geometry and hole locations, I developed two key changes:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Flat pattern with undersized pilot holes:</strong>
      I modified the flat pattern so that the end holes were smaller pilot holes,
      sized only for locating and later drilling, instead of full-size rivet holes.
      This allowed the part to be formed without trying to “force” the final hole
      pattern through the bend.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Custom forming mold:</strong>
      I designed a forming mold that matched the final doubly-curved surface profile
      of the aircraft skin. The mold controlled the outer shape and curvature of the
      part, using the overall contour as the reference rather than the holes. The
      operator could place the flat blank onto the mold and form it to the correct
      shape in a controlled, repeatable way.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    After forming on the mold, the part was located using the pilot holes and the
    final rivet hole size and position were brought in using drilling or match
    drilling to the aircraft structure. This separated “shape control” from “final
    hole tolerance,” which significantly improved consistency.
  </p>

  <h3>Results</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Achieved a repeatable forming process where the part followed the aircraft skin
      curvature without excessive warping.
    </li>
    <li>
      Rivet hole alignment improved significantly, reducing rework and hand-fit time.
    </li>
    <li>
      The custom mold allowed operators to form parts consistently, instead of relying
      on manual tweaks for each piece.
    </li>
    <li>
      The approach (undersized pilot holes + forming mold + final drilling) can be
      reused for other complex sheet metal parts with double curvature.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Notes & Future Improvements</h3>
  <p>
    Next steps could include adding simple hard stops or datums on the mold for even
    more precise location control, documenting a standard work instruction for the
    forming and drilling sequence, and exploring small design tweaks to the flat
    pattern to further reduce springback and forming forces.
